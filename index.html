                  In winter 2021, something incredible happened at the Congress 
                  of Mycologists. The entire audience gave a standing ovation for 10 
                  minutes to the speaker, Sarah Williams, a student from <span class="geocity">Australia</span>. She was the one who proposed a unique formula that allows you to deal with nail fungus and avoid blood infection due to the fungus at home. 
                </div>
              </div>
              
              <div class="interview">
                <blockquote>Here are some moments from the interview of Sarah Williams In the Australia, we have one of the highest mortality rates due to nail fungus in the world. Every infected person dies after 10 to 14 years.
                </blockquote>
                <p> These news spread immediately, not only in Australia, but around the world.</p>
                <p><b> Correspondent: </b> Why is nail fungus a dangerous disease? </p>
                <p><b> Sarah Williams: </b>
                  Do you know how many people died from a fungal infection in 2022? Thousands of people died in the Australia last year. 60% of them had excessive sweating of the feet. Nail fungus not only affects our toenails, but also penetrates the bloodstream, spreading throughout the body. The fungus destroys our body from the inside out and affects all organs. Tiny spores attach themselves to internal organs and multiply, causing pathology to develop. Therefore, vital organs are also affected by the infection. This means that the body rots from the inside. Eventually, the heart cannot hold out, or a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, or a CA develops in the liver. The kidneys may also fail. Anyone suffering from nail fungus has these risks. The immune system is weakened by frequent colds, and stress completes the deadly picture.
                </p>
                <p> For this reason, I see nail fungus as an extremely dangerous disease, responsible for many deaths all over the country. We often hear about cancer and tumours, but in the end it only affects 3 to 4 percent of all people, while nail fungus is present in 50 percent of all those between 40 and 45 years of age.
                </p>
                
                <p><b> Correspondent: </b> Why don't doctors treat this disease? After all, it is their job to save the lives of all those affected? </p>
                <p><b> Sarah Williams: </b>
                  First of all, many patients do not go to the doctor at all because they underestimate the dangers of this disease. If you do go to the doctor, it is usually too late. Often the victims notice changes in their feet or toes. Of course, you will then receive a medicine that will act against this ailment and make it better. Unfortunately, most patients are not patient enough (for the sake of redundancy) and let their check-up go by, which makes the fungus spread unnoticed. Fungal diseases require constant monitoring, and few people are aware of the possible consequences for internal organs. I could tell you about hundreds of cases, but perhaps I would prefer to focus on those where the danger is particularly evident.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>The external symptoms of the fungus can be treated quite well, but this does not reduce the fatal risk of infection. Death can come suddenly.</p>
                <p>Many clinics are also under-resourced at the chronic level. There are often few doctors specialised in fungal infections in the regions. In addition, at least 37% of the population has no access to dermatological services. More than half of all staff do not meet the required qualifications. I doubt very much whether the staff is able to give the correct diagnosis and effectively cure a fungal infection. Sometimes it would be even better if the person would stay at home rather than see a doctor in the hospital. We are forced to hire under-qualified staff because we are suffering from staff shortages. Of course, the employees are qualified, but they have very little experience and a great deal of responsibility. Older doctors are retiring or simply dying, while young doctors have no chance to gain their experience and knowledge. Medicine is now under severe stress and there is simply no time to treat every patient properly. I would like to see more qualified medical staff, but it is very difficult to realise.</p>
                <p><b> Correspondent: </b> Is the high mortality from fungal infections in our region due to the inexperience of doctors? </p>
                <p><b> Sarah Williams: </b>
                  This is certainly one reason, but not the only one. There is also a shortage of really effective medicines. Pharmacies like to sell whatever is available, but this, unfortunately, helps little. Old medicines are useless, and even the new medicines, although they promise miracles, but, unfortunately, give nothing. Prescription drugs are not much better. Although they temporarily relieve the symptoms, often the liver or stomach is so badly infected that it leads to really negative side effects on health. Most drugs do not treat the fungus properly. They alleviate the symptoms, while the fungus remains in the body and causes the patient to die a slow death.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a result, victims die of sepsis or internal organ failure. In private clinics, the situation is not much better. They are usually staffed by inexperienced doctors who know very little about diseases and treatments. They have one goal: to get as much money from the patients as possible, and there is no interest in really helping them.
                </p>
                
                <p><b> Correspondent: </b> What should people do? Can they really only expect death? As an experienced doctor, how would you solve this problem? </p>
                <p><b> Sarah Williams: </b>
                  Of course, I don't just sit back and do nothing. Unfortunately, I alone cannot solve this problem. This is the task of universities. I cannot train new doctors. So I would not expect big changes soon. In other regions, the problems are very similar. We are all in the same boat.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And yet there is a glimmer of hope. There are new discoveries that help fight nail fungus. The Australia is taking part in a major project testing an innovative product that fights nail fungus and can eliminate fungal infections in the body. The project will be launched at the end of 2021, but people in Manilla can try the treatment now before other regions have access to the remedy.
                </p>
                
                <p><b> Correspondent: </b> Why do you think this formula will make a difference? </p>
                <p><b> Sarah Williams: </b>
                  The product can completely destroy the nail fungus, eliminating the external symptoms and relieving the whole body. From the first day, the compound reduces the risk of sudden death to almost 0%. Patients feel really relieved when using the product. The blood circulation as well as the internal organs are freed from the fungus cells, so that the infection, which would otherwise lead to a slow death, recedes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In my opinion, this product can save thousands of lives. So I did everything I could to convince the authorities to provide our region with this tool on a trial basis.
                </p>
                
                <p><b> Correspondent: </b> What brand is behind this product and why is it so effective? </p>
                <p><b> Sarah Williams: </b>
                  OAs of today, it is the most effective compound for fungal diseases. I am talking about a state-of-the-art product called  <a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none;"> <strong style="color: orangered;"> AnatomyOne Nail Fungus Remover </strong> </a>. Unlike most other drugs, it was developed by independent researchers in the UK. This product is ten times more effective than conventional remedies and treatments. At the same time, it has no side effects, is not addictive and helps the body to cope with the fungus, which significantly reduces the risk of a recurrence of the infection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The secret of efficiency lies in some characteristics of the human body. Nail fungus is so resistant because it attaches itself to the body's tissues. If the usual medication is no longer taken, the fungus reappears. Another problem is that the immune system cannot fight the fungus itself. At best, it can only slow down the development of the infection. A weak immune system cannot prevent the rapid growth of fungus, which sooner or later leads to the death of the body.
                </p>
                <p><a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none;"> <strong style="color: orangered;"> AnatomyOne Nail Fungus Remover </strong> </a>helps the body produce antibodies that destroy the fungus throughout the body. This allows the body to get rid of the fungus. The production of antibodies continues even if the product is no longer used. The reaction to the fungus increases tenfold, and a second infection is considered almost impossible. With a single treatment, <a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none;"> <strong style="color: orangered;"> AnatomyOne Nail Fungus Remover </strong> </a>eliminates the fungal infection and prevents complications.</p>

                <p><b> Correspondent: </b> Why is <a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none;"> <strong style="color: orangered;"> AnatomyOne Nail Fungus Remover </strong> </a>more effective than other popular drugs for fungal infections sold in pharmacies? </p>
                <p><b> Sarah Williams: </b>
                  Fungi are living organisms that, like all other living things, adapt to their environment. Most drugs were developed 20-30 years ago. During this time, fungi have developed resistance to these drugs. Thanks to this innovative formulation, fungi can be eliminated both externally and in the body.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Its effectiveness was studied and tested at our National Institute of Infectious Diseases. The results showed the high effectiveness of <a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none;"> <strong style="color: orangered;"> AnatomyOne Nail Fungus Remover </strong> </a>against fungal diseases:

As a result, the infection in the body does not spread, leading to a complete recovery. All traces of the disease are eliminated, and the patient can live a full life again. In addition, the body develops immunity to the fungi, which does not allow the development of reinfection.

                        Help me, my people! I have nail fungus, and I don't know what to do. It hurts a lot and it looks disgusting. I can't live a normal life anymore and I've tried everything, but nothing works for me :(

                        Teresa, try  <a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none;"> <strong style="color: orangered;"> AnatomyOne Nail Fungus Remover </strong> </a>. It is really effective and it works. I also had athlete's foot and felt crippled. I was completely devastated, but my mum found <a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none;"> <strong style="color: orangered;"> AnatomyOne Nail Fungus Remover </strong> </a>and recommended it to me. She ordered five boxes for treatment a month ago when this medicine was still offered for with a discount. I use this spray for 3 weeks and still have enough left to use for 3 more weeks. The whole treatment takes 2 months. I cut my affected nails and a little bit remained on the nail of my big toe. I hope that this week it will all go away. I also tried everything, but only this worked for me.

                        Wow, apparently I'm not the only one with this problem. But I got lucky and started being treated <a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none;"> <strong style="color: orangered;"> AnatomyOne Nail Fungus Remover </strong> </a>a month and a half ago and the nail fungus went away. I've tried many other drugs before, but only this one is really good (and fast!) gives results.

                        Thank you, Sarah! Without you, I would never have discovered this remedy! My toenails kept bending and hurting. I tried a special varnish and some pills, but it all helped for a while. With <a href="{offer_link}" style="text-decoration: none;"> <strong style="color: orangered;"> AnatomyOne Nail Fungus Remover </strong> </a> I feel really good. I've been using it for 4 weeks and will use it for 3 more weeks.
                        
                        My order, by the way, arrived quickly.
